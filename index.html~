	<p id="indent">I thought I was going to do a much better job at updating regularly. As I look at all my projects, I realize how different they are from each other. Some art stuff, meditation, kites, toys, research. At first glance, I saw no common thread.
	</p>
	<p id="indent">However, two themese stick out. Systematic Analysis of social dynamics, and aerospace. I have a bunch of portraits of heroes on my wall. They are inventors, systems theorists, entrepreneurs, and aerospace people. These projects strongly reflect those chosen inspirational peoople. And it makes sense. I love science fiction. And the best SF has excellent command and commentary on those subjects. Makes me want to write another book.

		I am uninterested in writing about my projects, at the moment. I wanted to touch this page though, so I cleaned the front page and stuffed all of the writing into their accordant links.
