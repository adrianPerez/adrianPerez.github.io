<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Vision Fast</b><br/>Two Vision Fasts. Four days of prep. Four days of fasting. Four days of coming back to the world. All in my backyard.</td>
    <td><b>Project Log</b><br/>A summary of how this log has changed. Why I am compling it. And what it has revealed to me.</td>
    <td><b>Braject</b><br/>A company I started to make bras that actually fit people. We achieve this through 3D scans and CAD based bra design.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Neural Net Style Transfer</b><br/>Trying to improve the output of the latest Recombinant Neural Nets that tackle transfering art styles from one image to another.</td>
    <td><b>Gas Lattice Fluid Part Designer</b><br/>An attempt to use Answer Set Programming and Sat Solvers to find parts that would satisfy thermodynamic criteria. Ex. Make me a jet engine with the following input and output.</td>
    <td><b>Quadratic Voting Experiment</b><br/>Explorations in quadratic voting, where the cost of votes goes up by the square. And then the total cost of everyone's votes redistributes evenly to citizens.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>3D Direct Manipulation Thermoforming</b><br/>3D printing that uses a probe to manipulate a sheet of locally heated plastic. The idea was to avoid the layer problems of traditional "hot glue gun" printing.</td>
	<td><b>Entrepreneur Partner Analysis</b><br/>It seems foolish to me that as a collective we do not study how founding business partners interact. If the failure rate of new ventures is so high, we should strive to reduce it.</td>
	<td><b>Four Phases of Idea Evolution</b><br/>Summary</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Ecotplasmanaut</b><br/>Summary</td>
	<td><b>Tesla Valve</b><br/>A no-moving-parts one-way valve. I designed one based on Tesla's patent and sell it over Shapeways, which 3D prints on-demand.</td>
	<td><b>Tetrahedral Kites</b><br/>Kites based on the tetrahedral designs pioneered by Alexander Graham Bell in his attempt to make the first airplane.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Story Meditation</b><br/>Summary</td>
	<td><b><a href="aguidetogalacticwarfare.html">A Guide to Galactic Warfare</a></b><br/>A collection of very-short science fiction stories I wrote and sold over Amazon Kindle.</td>
	<td><b>RingWing</b><br/>An aerodynamic toy that could be thrown in-doors. It ricocheted, boomeranged, and glided effortlessly.</td>

    <td><b>Pad Holsters</b><br/>Summary</td>
